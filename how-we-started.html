 <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
		 <p>Clinical Hemp Health (CHH) was born in Vancouver, BC, Canada in 2018 out of my deep passion to help people achieve optimal health and wellness with the support of hemp and cannabis-based supplements and natural health products. I have been researching and studying the cannabis plant for almost 20 years and have personally used it to effectively manage pain, stress, anxiety and sleep issues. Now, with laws and regulations changing throughout the world, the incredible benefits of the cannabis plant can help more and more people. My goal with every CHH product is to help people benefit from the wide array of health-promoting properties that the cannabis plant provides.

	 <h2> Research &amp; Development</h2>
			 <p>I’ve spent 18 months developing and testing our first set of health, wellness and medicinal hemp-based products. Our initial focus has been on CBD (cannabidiol) based products, which can provide people with all kinds of health benefits without any of the intoxicating effects that accompany the other popular cannabinoid, THC. That’s not to say that THC doesn’t have its place. In fact, THC is arguably the most powerful cancer killer found in nature.
