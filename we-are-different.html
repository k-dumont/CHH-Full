			<h2>What Makes CHH Different from Every Other CBD / Hemp / Cannabis Company?</h2>
			
			<p>CHH is very different. First of all, I want to tell you what we are not. We are not a big corporation. We are not a public company that’s traded on the stock exchange. We don’t have profit margin requirements or sales targets. We don’t have a board of directors or shareholders that we have to report to. And, we are not just a cannabis company—we strive to be so much more.</p>

		 <h3>What We Are</h3>
		 		<p>
Clinical Hemp Health is a small craft company that cares. We care about our customers and the quality of our products. Our number one goal is simple: to help as many people as possible, all while making the world a better place and giving back to our community. We strive to be Canada’s most respected and trusted health-care company and community.

			<h5>Here is a bit of background on how we came up with the name Clinical Hemp Health and the meaning that each part of the name represents:</h5>
<ul class="about-the-name">
			<li> <span class="about-the-name-box">Clinical</span> represents how serious we are about science, medicine, quality and R&amp;D.</li>

	<li><span class="about-the-name-box">Hemp</span> represents the cannabis plant and all of its wonderful properties, which we can use to nourish and heal.</li>

	<li><span class="about-the-name-box">Health</span> represents the main objective of our company—to help people heal themselves and improve health and quality of life.</li>

		 <h3>Our Unique Craft Production Process</h3>
		 		<p>
We tightly control the production of all our products. Our products are made in small batches, with a unique craft production process that we have developed ourselves. Our unique process and small batches ensure the highest quality and potency is always maintained. We will never sacrifice quality or potency for profits.

		 <h3>There’s a Name, a Face and a Family Behind This Business</h3>
		 		<p>
This is another thing that makes our company different: There’s a name and face behind Clinical Hemp Health. I’m proud of our company and stand behind our brands and our products. In addition to the science, research, testing and other important technical aspects related to product development, I also put a ton of care and compassion into creating each and every product. Not only do I make these products for our patients, but I also make them for myself, family, friends and other people in compassionate need. Quality and effectiveness is of the utmost importance to me.

		 <h3>Our Pet Division</h3>
		 		<p>
We have a lot of love for animals—so much so that it’s one of the reasons I adopted a plant-based lifestyle more than five years ago. Just like us, animals can also gain great health benefits from hemp, cannabis and CBD. Our Pet Division was really born out of the passion that my sister, Allison Gauvreau, has for animals. Allison is based in Guelph, Ontario, and is one of the top horse trainers in Canada. She’s been working with and training animals for the past 20 years. Allison and the honorary CEO of our Canine Division, Lola (our Pit Bull Terrier), are an instrumental part of the animal division. Through Allison’s network, we’re fortunate to have access to some of the top veterinaries and animal trainers in Canada.

		 <h3>Our Mission</h3>
		 		<p>
We really have one single-focused mission at CHH—to help people (and pets!) heal themselves and improve health and quality of life. It’s that simple. That’s the overarching goal of all our projects, including our sister project, MedicinalMushroomHealth.com. Our mission is to educate and give people the information and tools they need to achieve optimal health and heal themselves with natural medicines.

		 <h3>The Community</h3>
		 		<p>
When I was a child, my parents taught me about the importance of giving back. When I got my first part-time job as a kid, my dad used to always tell me, “Save some, spend some and give some to charity.” That’s something that has always stuck with me throughout my life. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to contribute to many local, national and global charities over the past 10 years through revenue generated from my sports supplement business. My vision for charity is even greater with this business, and a significant portion of all profits will be used to support real solutions to the mental health and addiction crisis in my local community of Vancouver, BC, and throughout communities around the world. We will keep you updated on our progress with these initiatives as we strive to make a real difference in this world.
