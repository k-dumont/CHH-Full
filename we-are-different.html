			<h2>What Makes CHH Different from Every Other CBD/Hemp/Cannabis Company?</h2>
			
			<p>CHH is very different. First of all, I want to tell you what we are not. We are not a big corporation. We are not a public company that’s traded on the stock exchange. We don’t have profit margin requirements or sales targets. We don’t have a board of directors or shareholders that we have to report to. And, we are not just a cannabis company—we strive to be so much more.</p>

			 <h2> Research &amp; Development</h2>
			 <p>I’ve spent 18 months developing and testing our first set of health, wellness and medicinal hemp-based products. Our initial focus has been on CBD (cannabidiol) based products, which can provide people with all kinds of health benefits without any of the intoxicating effects that accompany the other popular cannabinoid, THC. That’s not to say that THC doesn’t have its place. In fact, THC is arguably the most powerful cancer killer found in nature. (To learn more about the differences between CBD and THC, please visit our education section <a href="/cbd-thc">here.</a></p>
