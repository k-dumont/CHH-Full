		<h2>A Message from the Founder</h2>
		<p>
For the past 20 years, I’ve been formulating products and building brands in the health and sports supplement industry. But much of my time is now spent on my true passion project—studying, researching and developing various forms of alternative medicine derived from cannabis (hemp), fungi and other traditionally used plants. I want to help educate people on how they can achieve optimal health and heal themselves with plants, instead of prescription pills.</p>
